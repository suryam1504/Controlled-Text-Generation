# Controlled-Text-Generation

Currently working with the Yelp Restaurant and IMDB Review datasets, and extracting control attributes
such as Keywords, Style (sentiment), and Content (restaurant or movie related). The aim is to fine-tune
the GPT-2 model with the control attributes as input and evaluate the results for further improvements.

The codes and other files will be added later!
